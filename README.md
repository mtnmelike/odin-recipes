Hey everyone!

This is my 1st project for TOP on my journey to be a developer!
I wanted to build a website that includes dessert recipes and add some nostalgia with the Cookie Monster from Sesame Street.
I used inline CSS with basic properties in the HTML document, but when I feel comfortable with CSS, I'll do some updates and maybe add more recipes!ÃŸ
